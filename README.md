#Project Title<br/>
northcodersNews is an API created to serve news articles on a range of topics. These articles have comments associated with them, along with user information linked to these comments. Functionality includes opportunities to view all articles, view comments associated with articles, search articles by topic and add articles and comments when logged in. The user is also able to vote on articles and comments. Userers can delete comments that are associated with their username.

#Getting Started<br/>
To begin, clone the project, run `npm install`, and use npm start to run the app locally.

#Prerequisites<br/>
You will need:
Reach Router: can be installed with either `npm install @reach/router` or `yarn add @reach/router`

axios: install using `$ npm install axios`

#Working on the project<br/>
Scripts include `npm run build`

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`<br/>

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
